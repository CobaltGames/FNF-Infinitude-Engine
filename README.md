# FNF Infinitude Engine
An FNF Engine, based on Unity.

## How to setup the Infinitude Engine for editing
1. Download Unity (This was built on version 2021.3.24f1)
2. Download the Project
3. Open the project folder ("Infinitude Engine")
4. Start editing!

### MOD SUPPORT:
As of now (0.1) you aren't able to create mods without editing the project directly
I plan on using the Persistent Data Folder for mods
